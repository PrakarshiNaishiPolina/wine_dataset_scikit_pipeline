# Wine Classification Using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This script demonstrates the use of logistic regression to classify wine samples from the famous Wine dataset. Using a pipeline, the data is preprocessed and modeled efficiently, providing insights into the prediction performance.

## Features
- **Wine Dataset**: Uses the Wine dataset from `sklearn.datasets`, which includes chemical analysis data for different wine classes.
- **Pipeline Implementation**: Combines standardization and logistic regression into a single streamlined workflow.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy score.
  - Classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements
Install the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas
